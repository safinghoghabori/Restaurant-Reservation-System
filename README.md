# Branch Naming Convention

To maintain consistency and clarity in our version control, please adhere to the following branch naming conventions:

### 1. Feature Branches
When working on a new feature, use the following naming pattern:

**Example:**  
If you are adding a new "collections" feature and your initials are "SG", the branch name should be: `feature/sg/collection`

### 2. Fix Branches
When addressing a bug or making a fix, use the following naming pattern:

**Example:**  
If you are fixing a typo and your initials are "SG", the branch name should be: `fix/sg/typo`
